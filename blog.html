          1.  Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ? 
        </h1>
        <article>
            <p>Rem :The rem unit in CSS always inherits its value from the base font size setting on the root element of the document,<BR>
                 irrespective of the computed font size. In HTML, the root element is always the html element. So you could use rems,<BR>
                but this would mean you’ll have to control all components on the page using the font size on that element. We use rem <BR>
                most of the time when focusing the size on an isolated component, rather than the whole html.<br><BR>
                Em :The “em” is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size .<BR>
                Ems are becoming increasingly popular in web documents due to scalability and their mobile-device-friendly <BR>
                nature.<BR><BR>
                Percent (%): The percent unit is much like the “em” unit, save for a few fundamental differences.<BR><BR></p>
                <h2>MAJOR DIFFERENCES</h2>
                 <p>In theory, both the em and the percent units are identical, but in application, they actually have a few minor <br>
                    differences that are important to consider. On the “Smallest” setting, ems are much smaller than percent, and when<br>
                     on the “Largest” setting, it’s quite the opposite, with ems displaying much larger than percent.<BR>
                While em is relative to the font size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root)<BR>
                     font-size.Rather than it takes only root html font size as an em type it has an identical function to em. </p>

                  3.  Explain in detail(​in technical terms ​ ) the specific changes in css3 
                </h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in<br>
                         a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,<br>
                         colors, and fonts. Before css3 css2.1, css2, css1 exists.CSS3 version introduced new features that allowed developers<br>
                          to style HTML elements with less CSS code. CSS3 is most notorious for modules that speed up the specification process.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h1>DIFFERENCE WITH OTHERS</h1>
                        <p>The main difference between CSS and CSS3 is that CSS3 offers new features and separates CSS into convenient modules. <br>
                            Also, CSS2 consisted of a single specification that defined individual features. However, separate documents (modules)<br>
                            introduced CSS3 features.<br><br></p> 
                        <h1>Overview of New Features</h1>
                        <h2>Box Shadow</h2>
                        <p>
                        One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shadow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using multiple images<br>
                         around an item, this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.<br></p>
                        <h1>Opacity</h1>
                        <p>
                        One of the CSS3 properties called opacity makes elements see-through or completely transparent. For instance, you can<br>
                         apply opacity to images or other HTML elements. The transparency level depends on the indicated values.<br><br></p>
                        
                        <h1>Rounded Corners</h1>
                        <p>Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply<br>
                             the border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.<br><br></p>
                        <h1>Attribute Selectors</h1>
                        <p>CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling,<br>
                         developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes. As a result, you do not have to create unique <br>
                         IDs only to apply CSS rules.<br></p>
                        <h1>New Colors</h1>
                        <p>One of the CSS3 features is the addition of new colors:<br>
                        <ul class="fo">
                            <li>RGBA</li>
                            <li>HSL</li>
                            <li>HSLA</li>
                            <li>Gradient Colors</li>
                        </ul></p>	
                        <h1>More than Web-Safe Fonts</h1>
                        <p> <br>
                         CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same.But css3 only using fonts labeled as web-safe,<br>
                          which let us apply more unique fonts in HTML documents.And it upgrades modules which are separate components of the <br>
                          language this are User Interface ,Backgrounds, Borders, Media Queries, Transforms, Text Effects, Multiple Column<br>
                           Layout Animation.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h1>CSS3 Features: Useful Tips</h1>
                        <p><ul class="fo">
                            <li>CSS3 supports responsive designs and manages media queries (used for determining users' devices and screen sizes).<br></li>
                            <li>Since CSS3 new features let you produce fewer lines of code, you can boost the website speed.</li>
                            <li>Since CSS3, CSS animations move without JavaScript or Flash code.</li>
                        </ul></p>
